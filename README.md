# :flight_departure:	Flight-Inspection-App :flight_arrival:	


> First milestone
> 1) Using the .NET Framework, OxyPlot and Caliburn.Micro to create the GUI interface.
> 2) Using MVVM architecture in a multi-threaded environment.
> 3) Implementing a TCP Client to send the data to FlightGear.


## Project Description
This is an application that allows to display flight data on a dedicated simulator (FG) and perform n data investigation.
The application is designed for flight researchers, Air Force pilots or any pilot who wants to improve himself for future flights. 
The application presents the pilot all of his flight's data in various display forms, as a post flight process.
It allows the pilot to control the speed of a movie play (slower or faster) and perform an in-depth analysis of data relative to the pilot's other flights: Steering position, speed, direction of flight, altitude, yaw and roll indices, pitch, perform corrosion relative to other flights, load algorithms that study the information, etc ....



## Special features

-	Ability to watch the data in several different views, at any given time during the flight.
-	Ability to present the flight movie at a variable speed
-	The ability to present the aircraft joystick along with other metrics
-	Check correlations from other flights
-	Load different algorithms to perform in-depth research
-	A user interface that displays only the necessary information at a time, thus preventing overloading of the researcher.
